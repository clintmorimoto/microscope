*Collections
In chapter one, we spoke about the core feature of Meteor, the automatic synchronisation of data
between client and server.

In this chapter, we’ll take a closer look at how that works, and observe the operation of the key
piece of technology that enables this, the Meteor Collection.

A collection is a special data structure that takes care of storing your data in the permanent,
server-side MongoDB database, and then synchronising it with each connected user’s browser in
real-time.

In this program, since we want our posts to be permanent and shared between users, so we’ll start by creating a
collection called  Posts  to store them in.

Collections are pretty central to any app, so to make sure they are always defined first we’ll put
them inside the  lib  directory.
